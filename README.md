## üí° Usage

### 1) Initialize Your Repository

Create `~/.dfl` and initialize it as a Git repo:

```bash
dfl init
```

### 2) Add and Commit a Dotfile

Automatically move a file into the repo, create a symlink back, and commit:

```bash
dfl add ~/.bashrc
```

> Tip: Repeat `dfl add` for other files like `~/.zshrc`, `~/.gitconfig`, `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`, etc.

### 3) Deploy on a New Machine

Link everything from your `~/.dfl` repo into the home directory:

```bash
dfl link
```

(If your tool uses a different subcommand name like `deploy`, replace accordingly.)
